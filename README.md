# WeatherForcaster
Uses the machine learning library TensorFlow to create a neural network model that predicts the temperature in Miami. The model uses the cyclical nature of temperature throughout the year, the previous days temperature, and the mean temperature over the last week to predict the mean temperature on a particular day.
